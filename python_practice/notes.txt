************************************************************************************
 Dictionaries allow you to connect pieces of information, but they don’t
 keep track of the order in which you add key-value pairs. If you’re creating
 a dictionary and want to keep track of the order in which key-value pairs
 are added, you can use the OrderedDict class from the collections module.



If you don't give the array() function a data type, it will assume that it is dealing with
floating point numbers.(We were creating a record list then :) )
